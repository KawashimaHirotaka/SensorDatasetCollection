# Sensor Dataset Collection
Sensor Dataset Collection for Machine Learning.

---
Image, NLP etc. major domain of machine learning has many famous dataset. 
For example, [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), [CIFAR series](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html),
[PTB dataset](http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/%7Eimikolov/rnnlm/).
However, Machine learning using sensor data does not have such a famous dataset.

## Purpose
Machine Learning using sensor-data will become an important field in the future, 
However, there is no easy way to access the data sets, nor is there a well-known data set.

Purpose of this project is to provide 3 applications.

  - Sensor Dataset Loader 
  - Preprocessing function for sensor data.
  - Examples using sensor data
